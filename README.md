# liri-node-app
This project involves me making LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI, however, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives the user back data.
