<b>*Application Objectives*</b>
<br>

  * This project involves me making LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI, however, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives the user back data.

<b>*Additional Information (Slightly Less Relavent)*</b>
<br>

  * User will enter node liri.js and then one of the following in the console:
  		-- 'my-tweets'
  			++ If entered, a list of twenty tweets will show
  			++ Example: node liri.js my-tweets
  		-- 'spotify-this-song'
  			++ If entered, the user will need to enter a song name after 'spotify-this-song' to show 20 results.
  			++ Example: node liri.js spotify-this-song Back in Black
  		-- 'movie-this'
  			++ If entered, the user will need to enter a song name after 'spotify-this-song' to show 20 results.
  			++ Example: node liri.js spotify-this-song Men in Black
  		-- do-what-it-says'
  			++ If entered, this will pull a song from a random text file, and this info will display to the console. By default, this is "I Want it that Way"
  			++ Example: node liri.js do-what-it-says
